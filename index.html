    I am a full stack web developer, former journalist, and lifelong learner. I currently work for <a href="https://www.studyabroadapartments.com" target="_blank">Study Abroad Apartments</a>, where I am the sole engineer helping students find suitable accomodations in Europe.
  </p>
  <p>
        I also mentor graduates and teach junior web developers at <a href="https://generalassemb.ly" target="_blank">General Assembly</a>, where I also honed my craft some years ago. If you are a graduate of GA or you are interested in starting to learn to code, I would love to have you in my class. Please get in touch if you would like to <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/instructors/vincent-trivett/5998" target="_blank">attend my next class</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I live in the Greenpoint neighborhood of Brooklyn, NY with a sweet Siberian cat named Frances. I can often be found jaunting around the city and its environs on my bicycle or reading in bars.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am constantly studying and learning more stuff, especially anything related to technology, language, and history. Currently, I am taking Spanish classes while also keeping up to date with web technology.
