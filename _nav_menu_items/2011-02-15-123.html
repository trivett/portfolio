<p>I am a freelance journalist and photographer currently based in New York City.  At the moment, I am studying economic reporting and interactive journalism at CUNY’s Graduate School of Journalism. Until last summer, I lived in Yokohama, Japan where I wrote for the Yokohama Seasider Magazine, Koe Magazine, and the Japan Beer Times. I speak Japanese fluently. I am very interested in photography and data visualization and I hope to learn more about these things.</p>
<p>Please have a look at my curriculum vitae to learn more about me.</p>
