# Study Abroad Apartments — Lead engineer: Full stack



_July 2016 - Present_





Developed an online booking platform for students seeking housing abroad.

I worked on every level of the stack, including feature inception, design, implementation, automated testing, QA, deployment, and support for non-technical managers and admins.

Integrated the product with third-party services and APIs managed by hosing providers and management companies. I was often called upon to deal directly with business contacts in multiple countries.

After about seven months of working solo, I brought on an apprentice developer, a recent bootcamp graduate. Transitioning from working in isolation to managing a team required organization and codified process. I instituted agile processes, strict guidelines for code review, dedicated time to refactor and improve test suites, and deployment planning for large releases. 

Re-worked legacy code and infrastructure inherited from an offshort dev shop. Some of my earliest priorities were to create an SSL Certificate to serve the site securely and begin backing up business-critical data and assets.  The former was achieved with Let's Encrypt. 

I took it upon myself to leverage third-party tools for monitoring, continuous integration, logging, and exception reporting.

The codebase that we inherited used some very strange processes and technology choices. One very satisfying and sizeable refactor that we undertook was taking our existing Angular codebase and converting the code from CoffeeScript to modern ECMAScript 6.

Currently working on transitioning from a monolithic Rails app to API-driven microservices that can power multiple sites to serve different markets.

Technologies and tools used:

* Ruby on Rails
* PostgreSQL
* Heroku
* Angular JS 1.5
* ES6
* Object Oriented JavaScript
* Git and Github (of course)
* Hubspot CRM
* Zendesk
* Scout APM
* New Relic
* HoneyBadger
* Codeship
* Amazon S3
* Nokogiri and Mechanize for web scraping
* NodeJS
