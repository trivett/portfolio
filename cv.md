# My Story





My curriculum vitae in reverse chronological order:



## Study Abroad Apartments — Lead engineer: Full stack



_July 2016 - Present_

In my current role, I develop and manage an online booking platform for students seeking housing abroad.

I work on every level of the stack, including feature inception, design, implementation, automated testing, QA, deployment, and support for non-technical managers and admins.

Integrated the product with third-party services and APIs managed by hosing providers and management companies. I was often called upon to deal directly with business contacts in multiple countries.

After about seven months of working solo, I brought on an apprentice developer, a recent bootcamp graduate. Transitioning from working in isolation to managing a team required organization and codified process. I instituted agile processes, strict guidelines for code review, dedicated time to refactor and improve test suites, and deployment planning for large releases. 

Part of my job involves re-working legacy code and infrastructure inherited from an offshore dev shop. Some of my earliest priorities were to create an SSL Certificate to serve the site securely and begin backing up business-critical data and assets. The former was achieved with Let's Encrypt. 

I took it upon myself to leverage third-party tools for monitoring, continuous integration, logging, and exception reporting.

The codebase that we inherited used some very strange processes and technology choices. One very satisfying and sizeable refactor that we undertook was taking our existing Angular codebase and converting the code from CoffeeScript to modern ECMAScript 6.

Currently working on transitioning from a monolithic Rails app to API-driven microservices that can power multiple sites to serve different markets.

Technologies and tools used: Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, Heroku, Angular JS 1.5, ES6, Object Oriented JavaScript, Git and Github (of course), Scout APM, New Relic, HoneyBadger, Codeship, Amazon S3, Cloudflare DNS, Let's Encrypt,  Hubspot CRM, Zendesk, Nokogiri and Mechanize for web scraping, and Ubuntu as my desktop operating system.


## General Assembly — Instructor / Mentor

_July 2015 - Present_



I have taught and mentored students in several capacities at General Assembly, an innovative global education company where I myself honed my skills as a web developer. I started as a teaching assistant, then became a lead instructor for Back End Web Development, then began hosting a weekly mentoring session for graduates of that class as well as Web Development Immersive. In some ways, teaching helps me learn and retain concepts and makes me a better programmer. 

In July and August of 2015, I filled in as a teaching assistant for Back End Web Development, which served as a refresher for me regarding Ruby and Rails since at that point it had been a year since I had worked in Rails. 

I taught and managed a class of my own from November 2015 to February 2016. This was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life. I developed my own curriculum and planned out six hours of class time each week for a class of about 20 adult students with varying levels of ability. Most of them had never opened a terminal or declared a variable before, and by the end of the class, they all had working web applications deployed to the open web. We focused on Ruby and Rails, but covered some front end technology as well. 

Unfortunately, GA decided to stop offering the class before my cohort was through. I continue to work with GA however. Every Thursday, I host a mentoring group for recent graduates of Web Development Immersive. At these two-hour sessions, I prepare a lesson to introduce new technology and help fill in the gaps that a three-month bootcamp education leaves. Some examples of our lesson topics are refactoring katas, Vim, testing with Mocha, regex, restful api design, Docker, SSH, deploying to AWS. 

I sometimes learn just as much as the students. They are mostly familiar with Node, and through teaching in Node, I strengthened my own grasp of Node and its burgeoning ecosystem.  Teaching on a particular tool requires you to understand a topic on a deeper level than just using it. I need to anticipate student questions and know why things are set up in a certain way rather than just how to solve a problem at hand.  

I also regularly teach short workshops at GA. I have taught a 16-hour Programming for Non-Programmers weekend bootcamp several times. This course aims to give non-technical workers who don't intend to switch careers an understanding of what web developers do and how they work. I find it very rewarding to work with beginners, showing them the vast world of possibility that opens up to you when you just learn some JavaScript.  



## 2U Inc — Implementations developer

_June 2014 - July 2016_

Three weeks after graduating from GA's Web Development Immersive program, I began work as a developer on the Implementations team at 2U, a leading online education platform that serves numerous top universities such as Yale, Syracuse and Northwestern.

My team was tasked with bringing new university programs online. This meant developing and deploying a version of each product that we offer for that program. First, we had to create the informational and marketing sites for the program, then the online application and recommendation system, and finally, the online campus environment where the students will ultimately take classes. 

This was a huge challenge due to the complexity of their infrastructure. Oftentimes, we had to work on multi-tenant servers and Salesforce orgs. Quite a greate deal of my role involved delicate server configuration. Adding to our challenge was that we were deploying software developed by other teams. We had to stay on top of what the entire organization was up to to the best of our ability. Each team and each repo was written in another language or framework altogether, and oftentimes those frameworks were forked so long ago that there were no easy 'google the error message' bugs to fix. Patient tracing of errors through the stack, sometimes across different services was all we could do before resorting to asking for help from another team. 

There was a lot of repetitive stuff that we were expected to do, and when faced with that, we did everything in our power to auomate away the boring stuff. Some of our tools for scripting ourselves out of work went on to become core parts of 2U's business, as we were able to use them to bring programs from inception to live much more quickly.

At 2U, I was exposed to Python, PHP, Flask, NodeJS, CoffeeScript, Pyramid, Clojure, and various in-house frameworks. I also had the privilege of working with some of the smartest people that I had ever met. 2U also gave us all ongoing education and professional development through lunch-and-learns and online classes. I also consider my experience with 2U valuable because it got me used to collaborating wtih a huge and diverse team with deadline pressure and the responsibility of stewarding the namesake of prestigious universities. As a new developer, it hugely beneficial to work with a team that focused on process and best practices, which is not something that you really learn as a solo developer or a bootcamp student. Meeting students who had changed their lives as a result of the software that we wrote was also quite rewarding.

# Before becoming a professional web developer

## Freelance journalism and translation

Both before and after graduating from CUNY, I worked for various outlets as a freelance journalist and translator. Some highlights of my former career:

* **Reporter and translator for Bright Wave Media**: While living in Japan, I played a part in starting a few magazines with a friend and colleague. I reported on arts and culture in Yokohama, inteviewed subjects in Japanese, translated Japanese copy into English, took photos, and assisted with layout, advertising sales, and packaging magazines for distribution. With a small team of friends, we created _Yokohama Seasider_, _Koe_, and the _Japan Beer Times_. I am proud to have played a role in the creation of this company early on. Though it ultimately ended up not working out for me, this experience inspired me to start a career in journalism.
* **Trends reporter for Skift**: I produce in-depth bi-monthly industry reports on trends in travel. This work entailed scoring and conducting interviews, sometimes with C-level executives, writing about 20+ pages of content, fact checking, editing, and creating graphs to present data. 
* **Intern at Business Insider**: I conceived and wrote stories for an enormous online audience, focusing on economic and financial news.
* **Freelance translator for Nippon TV**: On a few occasions, I worked as a guest translator for the New York branch of Nippon TV (aka Nittere or Nichi Terebi). I took stories by Japanese reporters, translated into broadcast-friendly English for distribution by NBC Universal.
* **"A small percentage": my capstone project in interactive journalism**: I spent a year delving into the business of financial remittances by migrant workers to their home countries. What I discovered was a level of quietly tolerated exploitation that few people put have occasion to think about. With few options and almost no transparency, some of the most marginalized workers in the United States pay far more than necessary to remit money to their families. That small percentage fee that they pay, coupled with inflated exchagne rates adds up. It comes out of small paychecks, and when it arrives, it means that there is less money to pay for food, children's education etc. The companies that provide this service make a mint in profits, at least those that provide numbers. Now that I am not a journalist, I can say drop the veneer of 'objectivity' and say what a bullshit situation that is. I have no problem with a company charging for a necessary service, but this one is just particularly rapacious. I interviewed activists, startup entrepreneurs hoping to disrupt the industry, migrant workers, and internationall recognized economists to produce an interactive package on this opaque industry that most of us never have to come into contact with. I used WordPress, and animations to show data and reporting that I gathered. After I put it on the web, part of it was run by City Limits magazine. 
* My work has also appeared in Quartz, WNYC, and other outlets.

## Ancient history

Before going to graduate school, I was an English teacher in the public schools of Yokohama, Japan.
