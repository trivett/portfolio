<p>Despite lackluster performance across the sector, bank chiefs' 2010 pay increased by an average of 36% over 2009, according to <a id="itxthook0" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/high-wall-street-salaries-now-reason-for-layoffs-2011-6#" rel="nofollow">data</a> compiled by the <a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/bb5b697a-95a6-11e0-8f82-00144feab49a.html">Financial Times</a>.</p>
<p>Banker salaries, which are typically uniform across each class of employee, increased, too, while bonuses dropped (three examples: <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/wall-street-interns-are-now-making-100000-per-year-quants-2011-5">here</a> and <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/young-wall-street-analysts-now-getting-paid-220000-300000-to-2011-6">here</a> and <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/banker-pay-crisis-bonus-base-millions-2011-4">here</a>).</p>
<p>There are a couple of good reasons why salaries jumped. <a title="Bank CEO Pay Up 36%" href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/43404883">CNBC</a> among others have pointed out that without high pay, banks might experience a talent exodus. (They might have been right, considering that London started demanding 50% of bankers' bonus pay, <a title="A Huge Failure" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/londons-50-bonus-tax-continues-to-fail-miserably-now-costing-city-791-million-2010-10">prompting a disastrous hedge fund exodus from the city</a>.) And some banks increased regular salaries and de-emphasized bonuses to discourage to the risky behavior that contributed to the financial crisis.</p>
<p>But now those salary hikes might are being <a href="http://mycrains.crainsnewyork.com/in_the_markets/2011/06/higher-salaries-to-trigger-wall-street-job-losses.php">cited as part of the reason</a> that job losses are about to hit the sector. (The main reason of course, is the aforementioned lackluster <a id="itxthook1" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/high-wall-street-salaries-now-reason-for-layoffs-2011-6#" rel="nofollow">performance</a>.)</p>
<p><a href="http://mycrains.crainsnewyork.com/in_the_markets/2011/06/higher-salaries-to-trigger-wall-street-job-losses.php">Crains New York writes</a>:</p>
<p>The salary increases have left the banks with elevated fixed <a id="itxthook2" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/high-wall-street-salaries-now-reason-for-layoffs-2011-6#" rel="nofollow">costs</a> at a time of stagnant revenues. The situation, JPMorgan analyst Kian Abouhossein pointed out in a report Tuesday, is a formula for "material staff cuts."</p>
<p>The cuts could be most severe at Credit Suisse and UBS, which appear to have the highest fixed compensation costs.</p>
<p>Of course the simple answer would seem to be, cut salaries. But banks have to keep their salaries competitive across the industry. So it sounds like instead of cutting salaries, they're <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/total-jobs-cuts-could-run-into-the-thousands-with-goldman-jp-morgan-bofa-and-more-looking-at-layoffs-2011-6">cutting the employees</a> who they can't afford to pay so much.</p>
