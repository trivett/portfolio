<p>For <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/france-germany-could-also-face-downgrades-hedge-fund-2011-8#ixzz1VmQMoiKE">Business Insider</a>.</p>
<p>London-based Cairn Capital is betting on France and Germany losing their AAA status, according to a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/08/19/us-cairn-hedge-idUSTRE77I32120110819">Reuters report</a>.</p>
<p>The hedge fund, which manages $24.5 billion in assets cited potentially high <a id="itxthook0" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/france-germany-could-also-face-downgrades-hedge-fund-2011-8#" rel="nofollow">costs</a> of bailing out periphery countries throughout the European Financial Stability Fund and <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/whose-heads-will-roll-if-italy-goes-bust-2011-8">France's huge exposure to Italy</a> as reasons for a possible downgrade.</p>
<p>Graham Neilson, the fund's chief <a id="itxthook1" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/france-germany-could-also-face-downgrades-hedge-fund-2011-8#" rel="nofollow">investment</a> strategist told <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/blackboard/reuters">Reuters</a>, "France is likely to be downgraded either on its own metrics but more likely as a result of potentially higher EFSF costs. The bigger the EFSF, the more France is liable (and) the worse France's credit rating the more it could be liable."</p>
<p>A larger EFSF will also affect Germany's rating.</p>
<p>"Germany could also quite easily be downgraded if the EFSF is forced to be larger, in a scenario where France and Germany end up with debt to GDP ratios of 120-125 percent. That's not good, that's not AAA," Neilson added.</p>
<p>But this week, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/blackboard/angela-merkel">Angela Merkel</a> and <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/blackboard/nicolas-sarkozy">Nicolas Sarkozy</a> failed to come to an agreement that would increase the size of the EFSF.</p>
<p>Standard and Poor's recent downgrade of the United States did nothing to increase the Treasury's borrowing costs, and therefore it is not certain that a downgrade would affect bond yields for France and Germany.  The downgrade of the United States was seen by some analysts as an attempt on the part of S&amp;P to regain it's legitimacy after their colossal failure to accurately rate reams of mortgage-backed CDOs prior to the <a id="itxthook2" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/france-germany-could-also-face-downgrades-hedge-fund-2011-8#" rel="nofollow">financial</a> crisis of 2008.</p>
<p>Downgrades are often good predictors of actual defaults, but the markets are usually ahead of the ratings agencies.</p>
