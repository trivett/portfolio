<p>Bill Smead, Chief Investment Officer at Smead Capital Management is not just bearish on growth in China, he's looking towards a full scale recession in just two to three years.</p>
<p>Smead said that China is beset by bad loans that could add up to $1 trillion.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/43664527">He told CNBC</a>, "We know that one trillion dollars in the United States economy of $14 trillion caused a deep deep recession. So what is $1 trillion of bad loans going to do in a $6 trillion dollars economy, also an economy that  has moved aggressively towards real estate development as the core part of the growth of the economy?"</p>
<p>Smead said that China is due "to go through the cleansing" of bad debt.  He argued that China's incremental raises in interest rates, like yesterday's .25% increase, only "allows the bad behaviors to go on and it just means your bust is going to be bigger when you finally do it."</p>
<p><strong>Smead said that he fears that a bust in China could lead to a crash in demand for commodities and currencies.</strong></p>
<p><strong>He is even avoiding owning securities from countries most dependent on China. "We're in the camp that we don't want to own Australian bonds, we don't want to own Canadian bonds," he said.</strong></p>
<p>Moody's released a report earlier this week saying that <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20110705-700024.html">non-performing loans from Chinese banks can be as high as 12%</a></p>
