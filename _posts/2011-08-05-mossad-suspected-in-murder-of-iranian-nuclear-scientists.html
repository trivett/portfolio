<div>Intelligence experts suspect that the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad is responsible for the assassination of several Iranian scientists in an effort to disrupt the Islamic Republic's nuclear weapons program.</div>
<div>
<p><a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,777899,00.html">German magazine Der Spiegel reported that</a> "an Israeli intelligence source" admits that Mossad is responsible for the murder of Darioush Rezaei, a nuclear scientist.  Rezaei, 35, was shot on a Tehran Street right in front of his daughter's kindergarten on July 23rd. He was apparently spotted at a nuclear research facility north of Tehran.  According to the IAEA, Rezaei was developing high-voltage switches, which are needed to make nuclear warheads.</p>
<p>Since 2010, three Iranian nuclear physicists have been murdered in suspicious circumstances and one more survived. The unnamed source says Rezaei's murder "was the first serious action taken by the new Mossad chief Tamir Pardo."</p>
<p>Israel does not deny that they were involved in the killings. Grinning suggestively, Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak vaguely told reporters, "Israel is not responding."</p>
<p>Assassination is only one tool being used by the Israelis to disrupt Iran's nuclear program. Last year, Israel created a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/16/world/middleeast/16stuxnet.html?pagewanted=all">computer virus</a> that wreaked havoc on the program's computers.  Israel regularly makes phony companies for the purpose of providing nuke components that are designed to malfunction. Israel has proven itself unafraid to engage in air strikes against research facilities if necessary.</p>
<p>Iran has the delivery mechanisms available already.  If they were able to produce a warhead, they can make good on President Ahmadinejad's repeated threats to destroy the country.  Israeli military officials are growing more hawkish by the day, and support for a preemptive strike against the Islamic Republic is increasing.</p>
