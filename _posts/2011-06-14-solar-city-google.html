<p>For <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/google-just-put-280-million-into-solarcity-2011-6#ixzz1TMEqzhzB">Business Insider</a>.</p>

<div>Google just made another investment in renewable energy.The search engine announced a $280 million investment partnership with SolarCity, a major supplier of residential solar panels, <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2011/06/14/technology/google_solarcity/index.htm">CNN Money reports</a>.The Google fund will allow residential customers to rent solar panels without making a hefty up-front payment. Google makes its money back on the rental payments.Why is Google doing this? It loves all things green, and has been actively investing in alternative energy.</p>
<p>Google has put $680 million into clean energy so far and this is the largest single investment in the sector they have made to date. It sounds like a lot of money, but really for a company generating billions in cash per quarter, it's not a massive investment.</p>
