<p>Science and religion clash all too often. Yes, sadly, the culture wars aren’t over. Just the other day, <a title="Science Insider" href="http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2011/04/bill-allowing-teachers-to-challenge.html" target="_blank">Tennessee’s state legislature moved to protect teachers that wish to cast doubt on supposedly controversial scientific theories such as evolution and climate change.</a><br />
Science and faith seem to be mutually exclusive, opposite ways of thinking. However, many, if not most people keep both in their heads somehow.  Others don’t.  In this video, several New Yorkers share their thoughts on religion and science.<br />
