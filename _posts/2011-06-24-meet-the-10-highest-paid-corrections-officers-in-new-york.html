<div>For <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/206-ny-correction-officers-made-more-than-100000-last-year-2011-6">Business Insider</a>.</div>

<div>No wonder the state's reeling from a billion-dollar deficit.</div>
<div>
<p>Even while class size in schools inches up, MTA service deteriorates, and states and local governments continue to lay off workers, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/meet-the-8074-new-york-transit-workers-who-earn-more-than-100000-2010-9">some public employees are somehow able to bring home a handsome pay package from the state</a>.</p>
<p>Lawmakers have pointed out that the Department of Correctional Service Corrections officers' salaries aren't usually high, but the devil is in the details. Corrections officers <a href="http://www.docs.state.ny.us/Jobs/co_exam.html">start at just $36,420</a>.  After 12 months, that goes up to $43,867, and they enjoy a performance-based raise each year. This is close New York's average annual pay of $46,664.</p>
<p>So how do 206 of these officers make more than $100,000?</p>
<p>Usually due to under staffing and absences due to injury, there are many opportunities for overtime.  In fact, in FY 2008-2009, DOCS spent $87 million on overtime <a id="itxthook0" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/206-ny-correction-officers-made-more-than-100000-last-year-2011-6#" rel="nofollow">costs</a>.  That's one fifth of all the overtime costs that the state paid for, according to a State Senate investigation. The <a href="http://www.nysenate.gov/press-release/nys-corrections-costing-state-millions-waste">Senate Task Force on Government Efficiency</a> determined that DOCS could streamline their operation and save the State at least $15 million.</p>
<p>“The Department of Correctional Services has the worst track record in the state when it comes to agency spending on overtime pay. During tough fiscal times, the state cannot afford to write any more blank checks,"<a href="http://www.nysenate.gov/press-release/task-force-investigates-wasteful-spending-nys-department-corrections-0"> said Senator Jeff Klein, the chairman of the Task Force.</a></p>
<p>Apparently, that didn't affect these folks.  Here are the top ten highest paid corrections officers in New York State according to our <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/data_center/salary_2010">NY state worker salary database</a>.</p>
