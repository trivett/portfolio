<div>A boat carrying 25 dead migrants from Africa has landed in <strong>Lampedusa</strong>, an Italian island off of Africa's northern coast.</div>
<div>
<p>The rickety vessel was a mere 50 feet long, but was crammed with 296 people.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ansa.it/web/notizie/rubriche/cronaca/2011/08/01/visualizza_new.html_760063065.html">The ANSA News Agency reports</a> that the boat was discovered when it was 35 miles from Lampedusa. While it was being escorted to the island and less than one mile from the shore, the engines failed.  When rescue crews arrived, they found 25 corpses of young men in a state of partial decomposition stuffed into the engine room.  They might have been dead for as long as two days.</p>
<p>The fumes from the engine made it nearly impossible to breathe, but there was no way for the men to squeeze out. is They are presumed to have died of asphyxiation.</p>
<p>The boat departed from Libya, but the migrants on the boat included some women and children, mostly of sub-Saraharn origin.</p>
<p>Lampedusa is one of the European Union's outposts that is closest to Africa, and thus, it is a prime destination for asylum seekers and economic refugees. The conflict in Libya has driven up the numbers of migrants fleeing towards Lampedusa. Hundreds of workers in Libya from other African countries such as Chad have lost their jobs and in desperation, pay dearly to board chancy vessels for Europe.</p>
<p>Since the conflict began, <a href="http://channel6newsonline.com/2011/08/25-found-dead-on-boat-carrying-refugees-off-italy/">an estimated 20,000 migrants have landed on the island</a>. It is not uncommon for these jam-packed boats to capsize.</p>
