excerpt: Starbucks isn't going to settle for just two-thirds of the profit on the
  K-cups Green Mountain sells. The coffee giant is going to market its own competing
  machine to expand its share of the at-home coffee market.

<p>Et tu, Starbucks?</p>
<p><strong>Starbucks </strong>(SBUX) really stabbed its partner <strong>Green Mountain Coffee Roasters</strong> (GMCR) in the back last night when the ubiquitous coffee chain said that it will produce its own competitor to Green Mountain’s Keurig single-serve coffee system.</p>
<p>The Starbucks machine will be called “Verismo" (Italian for “realism,” also the name of a<em> fin de siècle</em> Italian literary movement) and will be able to make quick single-serve coffees, espressos, and lattes.</p>
<p>Shares of Green Mountain plunged as much as 24% in the pre-market today, and stabilized later. So far today, the stock price is down over 14%. Starbucks shares are up 2.28%.</p>
<p>Other competitors are ganging up on the Vermont-based company. <strong>Wal-Mart </strong>(WMT) will start selling its own single-serve system. Nestle’s Nespresso, currently the world leader in sing-serve coffee, is also trying to ramp up it’s market share in the US.</p>
<p>Starbucks will still sell their branded K-cups even after it releases a competing system.</p>
<p>Green Mountain, which once called the Keurig system the “iPod of coffee” followed the razor/razor blade model: Sell the machine near cost, and sell the K-cups at a high margin. This is similar to <strong>Amazon’s </strong>(AMZN) Kindle, <strong>HP’s </strong>(HPQ) printers, and <strong>Kodak’s </strong>(EK) film. These business models are essentially a license to print money, but once the patent expires this fall, that party will be over.</p>
<p>The loudest critic of Green Mountain, hedge fund manager David Einhorn, <a href="http://www.scribd.com/fullscreen/69460865" target="_blank">pointed out in a slideshow last year</a> that the company faced competition even before the patent expires. Einhorn thinks that the market for Keurig machines, which are more expensive than drip coffee machines and more expensive by the cup, is smaller than Green Mountain estimates. He also makes the point that Starbucks already makes two-thirds of the profits on the Starbucks-branded K-cups that currently sell in Starbucks stores.</p>
<p>When drug companies lose the patents for profitable drugs, they usually hope that the next cash cow is close behind in the pipeline. Green Mountain is trying to do this with its new <a href="http://www.greenmountaincoffee.com/vue-learn-more" target="_blank">Vue system</a>, and a future joint project with Lavazza. The myriad systems that will hit the market this year, including the Starbucks machine, will ultimately end up competing on price.</p>
<p>Lawrence J. Blanford, Green Mountain’s CEO and President, commented on the Starbucks announcement this morning. He hopes that the company’s dominant position will stick even after the patent expires.</p>
<p>“The two companies continue to collaborate with each other in the low-pressure Keurig Single Cup Brewing system in North America. As a leader and one of the few long-time participants in single-cup premium coffee brewing, we agree that there also is opportunity for complementary high-pressure espresso-based systems, as evident by our joint development work with Luigi Lavazza S.p.A. on a high-pressure capsule-based espresso system targeting North American consumers,” he said.</p>
