<p>Here is a little bit about the book:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Book Description</strong></span><br />
This volume is an appraisal of the past ten years of the Israel-Palestine conflict. Particularly following Israeli Operation Cast Lead in 2009, prospects for a viable Palestinian state existing alongside a secure and independent Israel seem increasingly out of reach. Nonetheless, peace initiatives remain largely limited to the prevailing two-state solution, without much serious attention paid to that paradigm's feasibility in the aftermath of: the Israeli separation barrier, rampant settlement of the West Bank, the crippling of Palestinian civil society by Israeli economic sanctions (and military campaigns), or growing loyalties among disillusioned Palestinians to militant groups like Hamas. Rather than attempt to articulate a new or more viable peace paradigm, this volume seeks to encourage more informed discussion of the present peace process by elaborating on its limitations in the aftermath of the past ten years. Featuring chapters from scholars of international law, political science, philosophy, history, and Middle East Studies, this interdisciplinary volume seeks to analyze the vicissitudes of the Israel-Palestine conflict over the past ten years, in a truly holistic manner.</p>

<p>Here is what some other academics have said:</p>
<p>"Choose any ten years in the history of Washington's Middle East 'peace process,' and you will find way more 'process' than anything resembling peace. Framing the most recent decade by two of its biggest disasters, Faruqi brings together a wide-ranging team of analysts to sort out why the failures continue-most importantly because of the longstanding U.S.-Israeli rejection of international law and human rights as the crucial basis for any serious solution. The assembly of Palestinian and other writers demonstrate how the 'two-state' model is, or soon will be, a hopeless anachronism-and crucially, the urgent need to consider new, not-so-new, different and creative alternatives for a just peace."</p>
<p><strong>—Phyllis Bennis, Institute for Policy Studies and author of <em>Understanding the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict</em></strong></p>
<p>"Over the past two decades, more and more Americans have learned the truth about Israel's brutal policies toward the Palestinians. This terrific collection of essays-which explains why recent attempts to settle the Israeli-Palestinian conflict have failed-is another major step in setting the record straight. Anyone who wants to know why the Middle East peace process never leads to peace should read From Camp David to Cast Lead."<br />
