<p>For <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/big-mac-index-2011-8#ixzz1VFQaNPoA">Business Insider</a>.</p>
<p>That the world has a single workaday product with a more or less identical recipe that you can buy in just about every country is a gift to the science of <a id="itxthook0" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/big-mac-index-2011-8#" rel="nofollow">Economics</a>. The Economist's <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21524811">Big Mac Index</a> is an ingenious way to understand Purchasing Power Parity.</p>
<p>For example, you can bring your $4.07 that you would have spent on a Big Mac to China and buy almost two.  A Big Mac in China <a id="itxthook1" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/big-mac-index-2011-8#" rel="nofollow">costs</a> 14.7 RMB equivalent to $2.27.</p>
<p><strong>14.7 RMB = Big Mac = $4.07, but 14.7 RMB &lt; $4.07</strong></p>
<p>This is one way of illustrating that China is undervaluing the yuan by 44% to keep export <a id="itxthook2" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/big-mac-index-2011-8#" rel="nofollow">prices</a> down. But there is a problem here.</p>
<p>14.7 RMB is much dearer to your average Chinese worker than $2.27 is to an American worker. Workers at American <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/blackboard/mcdonalds">McDonald's</a> stores make about <a href="http://www.payscale.com/research/US/Employer=McDonald%27s_Corporation/Hourly_Rate">$8 per hour,</a> depending on experience.  In China, a worker performing the same tasks for the same company makes <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/2007-08-07-1311013016_x.htm">5.80 RMB ($0.73</a>). So cheap Big Macs in China don't necessarily prove that China is unfairly manipulating their currency. Prices <em>should</em> be lower in countries where labor is cheaper.</p>
<p>This year, the Economist added another dimension to the Big Mac Index, controlling for per capita GDP.  Here, you can see that the Renminbi is hardly undervalued at all.</p>
