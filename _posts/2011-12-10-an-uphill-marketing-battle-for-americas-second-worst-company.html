<p>When Bank of America’s current Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan accepted his post in December 2009, he was lauded by his former bosses at Fleet Boston, Terrance Murray and Chad Gifford. He then joked, according to the Boston Globe, “Terry, Chad, who are we kidding? We know that we all report to Anne.”</p>
<p>Moynihan’s joke speaks to the importance of marketing for Bank of America. That Anne that he spoke of is Anne Finucane, Bank of America’s global strategy and marketing officer. Finucane might have one of the toughest jobs at the company—turning the image of what was then the country’s biggest bank measured by assets from a callous corporation and financial crisis antagonist to a friendly, community-focused bank. This task has become much harder due to the public missteps that the bank has made in 2011.</p>
<p>Maintaining a positive brand image is more important for Bank of America than competitors because of the sheer number of stakeholders that the bank has and the importance of retail banking to the business. About 57 million Americans hold some sort of account with the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank.</p>
<p>Serving retail consumers is more important to the Charlotte, North Carolina based bank than competitors. Loans and leases to consumers and business, together with credit card income and service charges make more than half of the bank’s $68.6 billion of revenues for the first nine months of 2011. Rival banks receive a lesser proportion of revenues from retail banking activities and more from asset management and investment banking.</p>
<p>Many of Bank of America’s recent ads deal with social issues that the bank claims to solve. One ad touts the bank’s role in building a solar-powered low-income housing project in Brooklyn that provided homes for families in the shelter system. Another ad deals with the bank’s charitable contributions such as donations to food pantries that are increasingly being patronized by the working families.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, for the bank, its efforts to cast itself as the good guy are lost on many consumers. Bank of America’s role in the financial crisis, its record of faulty foreclosures and acceptance of billions of dollars from the government was not unique. Despite the bank’s efforts to brand itself and reform its predatory lending practices, it is still bearing the brunt of consumer angst against the big banks.</p>
<p>Though the London-based Brand Finance Plc. valued Bank of America’s brand as the most valuable in the industry at $30.6 billion in February, the bank has also accumulated other less noble accolades. In an October customer satisfaction survey by JD Power and Associates, small business owners ranked Bank of America as the worst. Readers of Consumerist.com chose British Petroleum over Bank of America as the Worst Company in America by less than a one percent margin. Amplicate, the social media analytics company, found that 87 percent of opinions expressed about the bank on social media sites over the previous 12 months were negative.</p>
<p>Perhaps the worst decision on the part of the bank in terms of marketing and public relations this year was the aborted implementation of a $5 monthly fee for debit card use, after conditioning consumers to freely use debit cards instead of checks for years.</p>
<p>The announcement took place in September, against the backdrop of the Occupy Wall Street movement. Even before the debit card fees were announced, protesters targeted Bank of America for accepting bailout money, illegal foreclosures and influencing the government through lobbying (though Bank of America has significantly scaled back its lobbying to just over $2 million this year, considerably less than industry rivals.)</p>
<p>After weeks of outcry, Bank of America cancelled the plan to charge the $5 monthly fees.</p>
<p>During this difficult time for the bank’s public image, it didn’t help that the Bank of America website was down for days.</p>
<p>Kathleen Day, a spokeswoman for the non-partisan Center for Responsible Lending feels that the consumer backlash was misplaced.</p>
<p>“This was just a case of bad timing and it deflected criticism from even worse big lenders like Wells Fargo,” says Day, referring to Wells Fargo’s continued use of predatory practices that Bank of America has stopped such as overdraft protection and payday loans. “Consumer groups were not necessarily opposed to it because it was more transparent. Consumers will be charged one way or another. At least it’s explicit.”</p>
<p>Though charging customers up front might be considered more honest, it doesn’t necessarily win the hearts and minds of consumers.</p>
<p>“Since consumers pay a great deal of attention to the debit card fees, they notice it quite a bit,.” says Hooman Estelami, a professor of Marketing at Fordham University’s Graduate School of Business and author of Marketing Financial Services. “However had this price increase been implemented in components of the price that are less visible (such as late payment fees for credit cards or transaction processing fees) the average person would have been less alerted and quite likely such a response would not have occurred.”</p>
<p>Advertising Age Magazine later included the aborted debit card fee in a list titled, “Marketing Muck-Ups: The Biggest Follies of 2011.”</p>
<p>Mostly thanks to the debit card fee, Bank of America became the prime target of Bank Transfer Day, a social media-organized action that urged consumers to close their accounts with big banks and move their money into non-profit credit unions on November 5. Tens of thousands of people took part in that consumer protest and credit unions reported a surge in new customers.</p>
<p>Surveys show that Bank of America customers were the most likely to move their accounts. A poll by Harris Interactive found that only 40 percent of customers were “extremely” or “very likely” to continue banking with Bank of America and that 10 percent rated their satisfaction with the bank as “poor.”</p>
<p>So would this affect Bank of America’s bottom line in the future? Would the marketing missteps of the past year put the bank in such a bad light that it would lose market share?</p>
<p>Estelami, the financial services marketing expert is doubtful. He says that the propensity to switch brands is very low for the financial sector.</p>
<p>“The tying nature of financial services often prevents individuals to take the effort to change their bank, insurer, investment professional, etc,” he says. “The stickiness of this relationship far exceeds that of other markets, such as automobiles and home electronics where switching to competitors (at regular purchase cycles) is more prevalent.”</p>
<p>Estelami points to a study that suggested that people are more likely to change spouses than banks.</p>
<p>“The national divorce rate is higher than the bank-to-bank switching rate for customers. This is alarming. It also suggests that financial institutions can get away with quite a bit before a major switch occurs,” he says.</p>
<p>However, with the growth of the Internet and social media, dissatisfied consumers are more able than ever to organize broad-based protest movements.</p>
<p>Estelami notes that since the deregulation of the financial industry and the subsequent consolidation into megalithic national banking brands, nationwide movements against banks, once unheard of, are now more possible than ever.</p>
<p>“In that sense we are covering new grounds here,” he says.</p>
