<p>Film photography might seem like an anachronism these days.</p>
<p>It would seem like most fans of traditional analogue photography would have given up after <a href="http://www.kodak.com/global/en/professional/products/films/catalog/kodachrome64ProfessionalFilmPKR.jhtml">Kodachrome</a>, a legendary film that has been around since 1936, was canceled.  Kodachrome was one of the most significant mass market color films that recorded some of the last century's <a href="http://www.labnol.org/internet/favorites/the-young-afghan-girl-by-steve-mccurry/624/">most famous images</a>, inspired <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZpaNJqF4po">a song</a>, and even a <a href="http://www.utah.com/stateparks/kodachrome.htm">state park</a>.  The last roll of Kodachrome will be <a href="http://www.dwaynesphoto.com/index.html">developed</a> later this month.  Another blow came from Polaroid when the company <a href="http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/02/08/polaroid-abandons-instant-photography/">stopped</a> making their signature product.</p>
<p>However, there seems to be a small but significant trend of photographers young and old coming back, or holding on to film.  The photo sharing site <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> has <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/groups/?q=film">lots</a> of very active groups devoted to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/onfilm/">keeping film alive</a>. Other groups such as the <a href="http://www.lomography.com/">Lomography</a> are manufacturing lo-fi toy cameras such as the <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/features/the-cult-of-holga-the-sixties-camera-makes-a-comeback-797582.html">Holga</a> and Diana, that have caught on with artists as well as <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/photo/essays/vanRiper/010706.htm">photojournalists</a>.</p>

<p>For this audio slide show, you will hear from Dave Bias, formerly of <a href="http://www.savepolaroid.com/">Save Polaroid</a>, and the serving vice president of the American wing of the <a href="http://www.the-impossible-project.com/">Impossible Project</a>, a company that is continuing to make instant film for Polaroid cameras after Polaroid stopped making it.  The Impossible Project's gallery/store is located in <a href="http://shop.the-impossible-project.com/stores/ny">SoHo, NYC</a>.   Also, you will hear from Miles Rosen, a first year student at the <a href="http://www.schoolofvisualarts.edu/">School of Visual Arts</a> on what it was like for him to go from a life of digital photography to film.  Last will be the <a href="http://filmphotographypodcast.com/">Film Photography Project</a> founder, Michael Raso.  Raso is a filmmaker by trade, and also produces a regular podcast on film photography.</p>
