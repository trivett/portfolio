<p>For <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/elk-creek-rare-earth-2011-8">Business Insider</a>.</p>
<p>A tiny town in Nebraska might be where the US wakes up from its decade-long hiatus from mining rare earth elements.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/aug/2/rush-for-rare-earth-may-create-nebraska-boomtown/?page=all#pagebreak">The Washington Times reports </a>that Vancouver-based <a href="http://www.quantumrareearth.com/">Quantum Rare Earths Developments Corp.</a> announced that they have found significant amounts of rare earth elements and niobium in Elk Creek, a rural town of 112 people. The company and the US Geological Survey estimate that Elk Creek is potentially the <a href="http://www.quantumrareearth.com/elk-creek.html">"largest global resources of Niobium &amp; Rare-Earth Elements.</a>"</p>
<p>Niobium is an element needed to make strong heat-resistant steel. Deposits of Niobium in Elk Creek surpassed Quantum's estimates. The company found rich concentrations of "Europium, Gadolinium, Terbium and Dysprosium, associated with the Elk Creek Niobium Deposit" <a href="http://www.quantumrareearth.com/component/content/article/15-press-releases/127-heavy-rare-earth-oxide-enrichment-encountered-in-niobium-zone.html">according to their website</a>.</p>
<p><strong>A Boom Town in Nebraska</strong></p>
<p>Residents of the tiny town are reaping the <a id="itxthook0" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/elk-creek-rare-earth-2011-8#" rel="nofollow">benefits</a> of Quantum's exploration when the company started sample drilling in the area last year.  In addition to leasing land from several farmers, Quantum's workers are providing a surge in business in the sleepy town, where they rent lodgings and shop at local establishments.<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>Lacon Heidemann, a state Senator and local farmer <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/aug/2/rush-for-rare-earth-may-create-nebraska-boomtown/?page=all#pagebreak">told the Washington Times</a>, “It’s been a very, very positive experience for our community. When Quantum came in here, they put money in the local community. And any time you have money flowing in a small town, that’s a positive.”</p>
<p><strong>The Importance of Rare Earth Elements</strong></p>
<p>Imagine if just one country produced nearly all of the world's oil.</p>
<p>Deng Xiaoping was once quoted saying, "<strong>The Middle East has its oil, China has rare earth</strong>." This pretty much sums up the dangerous amount of control that one country has over the supply of elements that are crucial to clean energy <a id="itxthook1" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/elk-creek-rare-earth-2011-8#" rel="nofollow">technology</a>, smartphones, lasers, and defense technology.</p>
<p>China has a firm hold on the 17 elements classified as 'rare earth' elements.  China currently accounts for <strong>97% of all rare earth element production in the world</strong>.</p>
<p>After a 2010 diplomatic dispute, China showed that they are perfectly capable and willing to cut off the supply of rare earths when they <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/11/business/global/11rare.html">first officially, then unofficially banned exports to Japan</a>.  Without rare earths, the specialized <a id="itxthook2" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/elk-creek-rare-earth-2011-8#" rel="nofollow">high-tech</a> instruments that Japan exports can't be made. The <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/blackboard/toyota">Toyota</a> Prius, for example, <a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/engineering/news/important-rare-earth-elements">requires about ten pounds of Lanthanum</a> to manufacture. The boom in smartphones have spurred demand, and prices of these commodities have <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/article/seventeen-metals-%E2%80%9C-middle-east-has-oil-china-has-rare-earth%E2%80%9D">spiked dramatically</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/mcs/2010/mcs2010.pdf">According to the US Geological Survey</a>, the United States has about 13 million metric tonnes of rare earths that could be mined and saved for a rainy day if the Chinese halt or limit rare earths exports.  That's just over a third of China's reserves. The last US rare earths mine, the <a href="http://www.molycorp.com/">Mountain Pass Mine in California</a>, was closed down in 2002 after numerous environmental disasters.  The mine passed an inspection in 2007 and is set to reopen in the near future.</p>
