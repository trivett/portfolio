<p>For <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/debt-ceiling-stalemate-causes-a-run-on-us-bonds-treasuries-short-term-credit-2011-7">Business Insider</a>.</p>
<p>Short-term credit markets are already hemorrhaging thanks to the lack of progress on the debt deal in Congress.</p>
<p>This week, banks moved $37.5 billion from <a id="itxthook0" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/debt-ceiling-stalemate-causes-a-run-on-us-bonds-treasuries-short-term-credit-2011-7#" rel="nofollow">money market</a> funds that are invested in Treasuries and other presumably safe securities, <a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/07/28/debt-ceiling-debate-rattles-short-term-credit-markets/?pagemode=print">Dealbook</a> reported -- "the biggest weekly drop this year."</p>
<p>Just between Monday and Wednesday, investors pulled $17 billion treasury-only <a id="itxthook1" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/debt-ceiling-stalemate-causes-a-run-on-us-bonds-treasuries-short-term-credit-2011-7#" rel="nofollow">funds</a>.</p>
<p>Peter Crane, President of Crane Data, <a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/07/28/debt-ceiling-debate-rattles-short-term-credit-markets/?pagemode=print">told Dealbook</a> why these initial withdrawals should not be ignored:</p>
<p>"It’s big, no doubt about it,” he said. "Seventeen billion isn’t a run, but it’s definitely indicative that investors are shifting their assets. If this were to continue for another week or two, it would be very disturbing."</p>
<p>Yields on long-term bills haven't spiked, but bills coming due on the first Thursday after the Aug. 2 deadline have gone up by between 5 and 15 basis points.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, only a paltry $1 million was invested  in bills that come due in 81 days or more, a sign that investors want quick access to their money. Money managers at <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/blackboard/fidelity">Fidelity</a> are steering clear of T-bills that mature in the week immediately following the August 2nd deadline.  Just in case the unthinkable happens.</p>
